# `gate`

If you're familiar with my
[`fate`](https://github.com/AgentTroll/fate) project, then
you'll know that this basically extends on the idea of
helping you track non-natural satellites (e.g. the ISS).

This is essentially a more fully-featured astronomy tool
for someone like me, who is more interested in the software
than the actual astronomy (although the astronomy is pretty
cool as well).
